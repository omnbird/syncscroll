# SyncScroll Demo Document

## Why I Built This Plugin

I often read English technical documents in Obsidian while translating them into Chinese notes. During the translation process, I constantly face these challenges:

- Some technical terms are hard to remember accurately, requiring me to check the original text repeatedly
- After translating, I often find the expression isn't precise enough and need to revise it against the source
- The two documents have different lengths, making it difficult to find the corresponding position after scrolling

Previously, I had to switch back and forth between the two files or manually adjust the scroll position to compare them, which was very tedious. So I developed this SyncScroll plugin—just triple-click the line you're currently translating, and the other side automatically jumps to the corresponding position with horizontal alignment, greatly improving the efficiency of translation and comparative reading.

This is a demonstration document for the SyncScroll plugin.

You can use this file to test the triple-click line jumping feature.

When you triple-click any line in the left pane, the right pane will jump to the same line number.

The horizontal alignment makes it perfect for comparing documents or reading translations.
